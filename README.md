# Project Title  Door Opening System

A brief description of what this Project

The door sensor is an essential component used in-home security system. The designing of these sensors can be done with two parts which are arranged in parallel to each other. So that the circuit can be formed. When someone tries to open the door then these parts will get separated and breaks the circuit. So the control panel will activate to generate an alarm. 
These sensors are very easy to install and portable.

door sensors are the ideal for home security. These sensors are small and portable. The benefits of these alarms mainly include good security, keep the robbers away, protection of the child, peace of mind and deter danger.

Thus, this is all about the door sensor. From the above information finally, we can conclude that the main features of these sensors mainly include remote control, home security, and wireless installation

What is an Automatic Door Opener? An automatic door opener is an easy-access, simple-to-operate system for the doors of any type of business, industrial or commercial.Previously, ADA requirements for accessible design required the use of an automatic door system, however, it has increasingly become a measure of a customer-focused business.

Why sensors are used for control system? The role of a sensor in a control and automation system is to detect and measure some physical effect, providing this information to the control system.

How do you control a system? A control system is a system, which provides the desired response by controlling the output. The following figure shows the simple block diagram of a control system.

Which sensor is used in automatic door opening? optical sensors or motion detectors, which are installed on the sides of the gate to trigger its opening and closing. The sensors detect motion in front of the door.
