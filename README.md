# Project Title  Door Opening System

A brief description of what this Project

The door sensor is an essential component used in-home security system. The designing of these sensors can be done with two parts which are arranged in parallel to each other. So that the circuit can be formed. When someone tries to open the door then these parts will get separated and breaks the circuit. So the control panel will activate to generate an alarm. 
These sensors are very easy to install and portable.

door sensors are the ideal for home security. These sensors are small and portable. The benefits of these alarms mainly include good security, keep the robbers away, protection of the child, peace of mind and deter danger.

Thus, this is all about the door sensor. From the above information finally, we can conclude that the main features of these sensors mainly include remote control, home security, and wireless installation
